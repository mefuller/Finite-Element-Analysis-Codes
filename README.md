# Finite-Element-Analysis-Codes

### What this project is:
This repository contains finite element analysis codes written in Matlab and Python.

### Why this project is useful:
These codes are meant to be used for educational and research purposes.  They provide a basic framework where constitutive models can be implemented, additional analysis capability tested and developed, or just to use as a way to learn the fundamentals of the finite element method. 

### How users can get started with the project
Anyone is welcome to use the analysis codes for educational, non-commercial purposes.

### Where users can get help with your project
See the wiki for an introduction and documentation.

### Who maintains and contributes to the project
